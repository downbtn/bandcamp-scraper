# bandcamp scraper

Small program I wrote to scrape bandcamp and find free albums, and more
importantly to gain experience with Java and web scraping.

Currently, the program will ask you to enter the link to an artist/label page, then spit out some info on the artist/label and all their albums. However, you can't give it artists that have a layout of albums on their main page that isn't a grid.
