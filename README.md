# bandcamp scraper

Small program I wrote to scrape bandcamp and find free albums, and more
importantly to gain experience with Java and web scraping.

Currently, the program will ask you to enter the link to an artist/label page, then spit out some info on the artist/label and all their albums. This is useful when you find an artist that has a lot of albums, and you want to find which ones are free or affordable.
